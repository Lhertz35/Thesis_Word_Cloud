# Thesis_Word_Cloud
This code takes a .txt file and outputs a .png that can be printed on a US Letter size paper (8.5x11 in). After printing, the image can be inserted into a thesis as a fun way to give a snap shot of the work (in addition to the abstract, of course). 

The .pdf can be printed through a printer or taken to a printing shop for different paper quality.
